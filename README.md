# Catheter_insertion_simulator
The aim of this project is to create a simulator using the API SOFA that allows the user to perform
a realistic medical procedure. Specifically, given the exceptional capacity of the simulator to render elastic
behaviour of the materials, we strictly focused on endovascular catheter insertion, which is nowadays one of
the main topics in this area.
The final goal is to assemble an interconnected environment, comprehensive of a simulator (SOFA) and an
haptic interface (Geomagic), able to allow the user to move the instrument and at the same time receive
kinestetic feedback from the simulation. The resulting tool could be useful to physicians for both practising
in the catheter insertion procedure and during the real procedure, in order to have a 3D navigation system
and to be able to perceive the forces acting on the tip of the tool to have a better understating of what the
tool is in contact with, without the use of a camera.
